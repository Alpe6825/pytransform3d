Notation
========

We will use the notation :math:`_A\boldsymbol{t}_{BC}` to represent a vector
from frame B to frame C expressed in frame A, where frame refers to a reference
frame or coordinate system that is defined by three orthonormal basis vectors
and a position in three-dimensional space.

The position of a point :math:`P` with respect to a frame A in
three-dimensional space can be defined by
:math:`_A\boldsymbol{p} := _A\boldsymbol{t}_{AP}`.
